# **Prediction of the COVID19's effective reproductive number (Rt)** ðŸ˜·
## Comparative study between Portugal and other countries (European and non-european)

With the code here presented I expected to answer to the following questions:
- How has Rt changed in Portugal?; What about the various regions of the country?
- How does the *Serial Interval* influences the definition of the Rt?
- How has Rt evolved in other EU and non-EU countries?

In addition to these results, I also intend to evaluate the possible causes that have led to a possible discrepancy between values in the different countries.
